# Datasoc hackathon 2019

learnt a lot in a short period of time.
```
Challenges faced:-
- cleaning data was a big pain since i didnt know how to utilise pandas and numpy (but figured out < 10 hours before submission deadline 21 July 2019 @ 10 a.m.)
- did a bit of ml but it didnt work as expected (pretty much figure out the correlation and then use excel to change the values... GOTTEN AN Area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.63151)
